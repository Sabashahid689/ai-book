## Response Text
Successfully generated a comprehensive tasks.md file for the AI-powered book content chatbot. The tasks are organized in phases following a logical implementation sequence: setup, foundational components, then each user story in priority order (P1, P2, P3), and finally polish/cross-cutting concerns. The tasks follow the required checklist format with sequential IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths. The implementation strategy emphasizes an MVP approach starting with User Story 1. Parallel execution opportunities were identified, and dependencies between user stories were mapped out.

## Outcome
Complete task breakdown ready for implementation.
